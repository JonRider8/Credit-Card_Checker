This is a simple test file that checks if a given credit card number is valid or invalid by using the Luhn algorithm. Companies linked to an invalid card are then listed and can be contacted. 

Results are returned as a Set to avoid duplications.

Users can send individual arrays, nested arrays, or even a string of numbers to be tested.
